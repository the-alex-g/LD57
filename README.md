# Abysm
_A game for Ludum Dare 57

Theme: "Depths"_

Those pesky tentacles are attempting to emerge from the depths and destroy the world again. It's up to you, a weird cephalopod creature, to stop them.

Use WASD or arrow keys to move and left mouse click to teleport to the green dot. If you teleport through a tentacle, you cut it off and get points, shown by the green bar in the middle. When the point bar is full, you win.
If a tentacle touches you, you take damage, shown by the purple bar on the left. If you run out of health, you lose.
Each tentacle on the screen generates corruption, shown by the blackish bar on the right. If that bar fills up, you lose.

Being near the top of the screen increases the rate at which you heal, and being near the bottom of the screen reduces corruption faster.
